 * 8.22 (Knight’s Tour) 
 * One of the more interesting puzzlers for chess buffs is the Knight’s Tour problem, originally proposed by the mathematician 
 * Euler. Can the chess piece called the knight move around an empty chessboard and touch each of the 64 squares once and only 
 * once?We study this intriguing problem in depth here. The knight makes only L-shaped moves (two spaces in one direction and 
 * one space in a perpendicular direction). Thus, as shown in Fig. 8.26, from a square near the middle of an empty chessboard, 
 * the knight (labeled K) can make eight different moves (numbered 0 through 7).

 * 8.20 (Total Sales) 
 * Use a rectangular array to solve the following problem: A company has three salespeople (1 to 3) who sell five different 
 * products (1 to 5). Once a day, each salesperson passes in a slip for each type of product sold. Each slip contains the 
 * following: 
 * a) The salesperson number 
 * b) The product number
 * c) The total dollar value of that product sold that day
 * Thus, each salesperson passes in between 0 and 5 sales slips per day. Assume that the information from all of the slips for 
 * last month is available.Write an app that will read all the information for last month’s sales and summarize the total sales 
 * by salesperson and by product. All totals should be stored in rectangular array sales. After processing all the information 
 * for last month, display the results in tabular format, with each column representing a particular salesperson and each row 
 * representing a particular product. Cross-total each row to get the total sales of each product for last month. Crosstotal 
 * each column to get the total sales by salesperson for last month. Your tabular output should include these cross-totals to 
 * the right of the totaled rows and below the totaled columns.

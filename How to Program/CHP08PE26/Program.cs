 * 8.26 (Knight’s Tour: Closed-Tour Test) 
 * In the Knight’s Tour (Exercise 8.22), a full tour occurs when the knight makes 64 moves, touching each square of the 
 * chessboard once and only once. A closed tour occurs when the 64th move is one move away from the square in which the tour 
 * started. Modify the app you wrote in Exercise 8.22 to test for a closed tour if a full tour has occurred.

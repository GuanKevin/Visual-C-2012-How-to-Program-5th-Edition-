 * 7.36 (Towers of Hanoi) Every budding computer scientist must grapple with certain classic problems, and the Towers 
 * of Hanoi (see Fig. 7.17) is one of the most famous. Legend has it that in a temple in the Far East, priests are 
 * attempting to move a stack of disks from one peg to another. The initial stack has 64 disks threaded onto one peg 
 * and arranged from bottom to top by decreasing size. The priests are attempting tomove the stack fromthis peg to a 
 * second peg under the constraints that exactly one disk is moved at a time and at no time may a larger disk be placed 
 * above a smaller disk. A third peg is available for temporarily holding disks. Supposedly, the world will end when the 
 * priests complete their task, so there’s little incentive for us to facilitate their efforts.

/**
 * 5.19 (Sales Commission Calculator) 
 * A large company pays its salespeople on a commission basis. The salespeople receive $200 per week plus 9% of their 
 * gross sales for that week. For example, a salesperson who sells $5,000 worth of merchandise in a week receives $200 
 * plus 9% of $5,000, or a total of $650. You’ve been supplied with a list of the items sold by each salesperson. The 
 * values of these items are as follows: 
 * Item Value 
 * 1 239.99
 * 2 129.75 
 * 3 99.95
 * 4 350.89 
 * Develop a C# app that inputs one salesperson’s items sold for the last week, then calculates and displays that 
 * salesperson's earnings. There’s no limit to the number of items that can be sold by a salesperson.

/**
 * 3.26 (Diameter, Circumference and Area of a Circle) 
 * Write an app that inputs from the user the radius of a circle as an integer and displays the circle’s diameter, 
 * circumference and area using the floating-point value 3.14159 for π. Use the techniques shown in Fig. 3.14. 
 * [Note: You may also use the predefined constant Math.PI for the value of π. This constant is more precise than the 
 * value 3.14159. Class Math is defined in namespace System]. Use the following formulas (r is the radius):
 * diameter = 2 * r 
 * circumference = 2 * π * r
 * area = π * r^2
 * Don’t store each calculation’s result in a variable. Rather, specify each calculation as the value to be output in a 
 * Console.WriteLine statement. The values produced by the circumference and area calculations are floating-point numbers.

 * 7.24 (Perfect Numbers) 
 * An integer number is said to be a perfect number if its factors, including 1 (but not the number itself), sumto the 
 * number. For example, 6 is a perfect number, because 6 = 1 + 2 + 3. Write method Perfect that determines whether 
 * parameter value is a perfect number. Use this method in an app that determines and displays all the perfect numbers 
 * between 2 and 1000. Display the factors of each perfect number to confirm that the number is indeed perfect.

/**
 * 4.15 (Target-Heart-Rate Calculator) 
 * While exercising, you can use a heart-rate monitor to see that your heart rate stays within a safe range 
 * suggested by your trainers and doctors. According to the American Heart Association (AHA) 
 * (www.heart.org/HEARTORG/GettingHealthy/PhysicalActivity/Target-Heart-Rates_UCM_434341_Article.jsp), 
 * the formula for calculating your maximum heart rate in beats per minute is 220 minus your age in years. 
 * Your target heart rate is a range that is 50–85% of your maximum heart rate. [Note: These formulas are estimates 
 * provided by the AHA. Maximum and target heart rates may vary based on the health, fitness and gender of the individual. 
 * Always consult a physician or qualified health care professional before beginning or modifying an exercise program.]
 * Create a class called HeartRates. The class attributes should include the person’s first name, last name, year 
 * of birth and the current year. Your class should have a constructor that receives this data as parameters. 
 * For each attribute provide a property with set and get accessors. The class also should include a property 
 * that calculates and returns the person’s age (in years), a property that calculates and returns the person’s 
 * maximum heart rate and properties that calculate and return the person’s minimum and maximim target heart rates. 
 * Write an app that prompts for the person’s information, instantiates an object of class HeartRates and displays 
 * the information from that object—including the person’s first name, last name and year of birth—then calculates 
 * and displays the person’s age in (years), maximum heart rate and target-heart-rate range.

/**
 * 8.19 (Airline Reservations System) 
 * A small airline has just purchased a computer for its new automated reservations system. You have been asked to develop the 
 * new system. You’re to write an app to assign seats on each flight of the airline’s only plane (capacity: 10 seats). Display 
 * the following alternatives: Please type 1 for First Class and Please type 2 for Economy. If the user types 1, your app should 
 * assign a seat in the first-class section (seats 1–5). If the user types 2, your app should assign a seat in the economy 
 * section (seats 6–10). Use a one-dimensional array of type bool to represent the seating chart of the plane. Initialize all 
 * the elements of the array to false to indicate that all the seats are empty. As each seat is assigned, set the corresponding 
 * element of the array to true to indicate that the seat is no longer available. Your app should never assign a seat that has 
 * already been assigned. When the economy section is full, your app should ask the person if it’s acceptable to be placed in 
 * the first-class section (and vice versa). If yes, make the appropriate seat assignment. If no, display the message "Next 
 * flight leaves in 3 hours."

/*
 * (Digits of an Integer) 
 * Write an app that inputs one number consisting of five digits from the user, separates the number into its individual digits 
 * and displays the digits separated from one another by three spaces each. For example, if the user types in the number 42339, 
 * the app should display 
 * 4   2   3   3   9
 * Assume that the user enters the correct number of digits. What happens when you execute the app and type a number with more than 
 * five digits? What happens when you execute the app and type a number with fewer than five digits? 
 * [Hint: It’s possible to do this exercise with the techniques you learned in this chapter. 
 * You’ll need to use both division and remainder operations to “pick off ” each digit.]

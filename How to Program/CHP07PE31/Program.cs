 * 7.31 (Enhanced Guess the Number Game) 
 * Modify the app of Exercise 7.30 to count the number of guesses the player makes. If the number is 10 or fewer, 
 * display Either you know the secret or you got lucky! If the player guesses the number in 10 tries, display Aha! 
 * You know the secret! If the player makes more than 10 guesses, display You should be able to do better! Why should it 
 * take no more than 10 guesses? Well, with each “good guess,” the player should be able to eliminate half of the numbers. 
 * Now show why any number from 1 to 1000 can be guessed in 10 or fewer tries.

 * 7.33 (Craps Game Modification) 
 * Modify the craps app of Fig. 7.8 to allow wagering. Initialize variable balance to 1000 dollars. Prompt the player to 
 * enter a wager. Check that wager is less than or equal to balance, and if it’s not, have the user reenter wager until a 
 * valid wager is entered. After a correct wager is entered, run one game of craps. If the player wins, increase balance 
 * by wager and display the new balance. If the player loses, decrease balance by wager, display the new balance, check 
 * whether balance has become zero and, if so, display the message "Sorry. You busted!"

 * 7.14 (Exponentiation) 
 * Write a method IntegerPower( base, exponent ) that returns the value of base exponent For example, 
 * IntegerPower( 3, 4 ) calculates 34 (or 3 * 3 * 3 * 3). Assume that exponent is a positive integer and that base 
 * is an integer. Method IntegerPower should use a for or while loop to control the calculation. Do not use any 
 * Math-library methods. Incorporate this method into an app that reads integer values for base and exponent and 
 * performs the calculation with the IntegerPower method.

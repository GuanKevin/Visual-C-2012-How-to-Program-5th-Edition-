 * 4.16 (Computerization of Health Records) 
 * A health care issue that has been in the news lately is the computerization of health records. This possibility is 
 * being approached cautiously because of sensitive privacy and security concerns, among others. [We address such 
 * concerns in later exercises.] Computerizing health records could make it easier for patients to share their 
 * health profiles and histories among their various health care professionals. This could improve the quality of 
 * health care, help avoid drug conflicts and erroneous drug prescriptions, reduce costs and, in emergencies, could 
 * save lives. In this exercise, you’ll design a “starter” HealthProfile class for a person. The class attributes 
 * should include the person’s first name, last name, gender, date of birth (consisting of separate attributes for the
 * month, day and year of birth), height (in inches) and weight (in pounds). Your class should have a constructor that 
 * receives this data. For each attribute provide a property with set and get accessors. The class also should include 
 * methods that calculate and return the user’s age in years, maximum heart rate and target-heart-rate range 
 * (see Exercise 4.15), and body mass index (BMI; see Exercise 3.31). Write an app that prompts for the person’s 
 * information, instantiates an object of class Health Profile for that person and displays the information from that 
 * object—including the person’s first name, last name, gender, date of birth, height and weight—then calculates and 
 * displays the person’s age in years, BMI, maximum heart rate and target-heart-rate range. It should also display 
 * the “BMI values” chart from Exercise 3.31.

 * 7.39 (Computer-Assisted Instruction) 
 * The use of computers in education is referred to as computer- assisted instruction (CAI). Write a program that will 
 * help an elementary school student learn multiplication. Use a Random object to produce two positive one-digit integers. 
 * The program should then prompt the user with a question, such as How much is 6 times 7? The student then inputs the 
 * answer. Next, the program checks the student’s answer. If it’s correct, display the message "Very good!" and ask 
 * another multiplication question. If the answer is wrong, display the message "No. Please try again." and let the 
 * student try the same question repeatedly until the student gets it right. A separate function should be used to 
 * generate each new question. This function should be called once when the app begins execution and each time the 
 * user answers the question correctly.

/**
 * 7.15 (Hypotenuse of a Right Triangle) 
 * Write method Hypotenuse that calculates the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle when the lengths of the other 
 * two sides are given. The method should take two arguments of type double and return the hypotenuse as a double. 
 * Incorporate this method into an app that reads values for side1 and side2 and performs the calculation with the 
 * Hypotenuse method. Determine the length of the hypotenuse for each of the triangles in Fig. 7.16.

 * 7.16 (Multiples) 
 * Write method Multiple that determines, for a pair of integers,whether the second integer is a multiple of the first. 
 * The method should take two integer arguments and return true if the second is a multiple of the first and false 
 * otherwise. Incorporate this method into an app that inputs a series of pairs of integers (one pair at a time) and 
 * determines whether the second value in each pair is a multiple of the first.

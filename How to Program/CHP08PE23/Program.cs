 * 8.23 (Knight’s Tour: Brute-Force Approaches) 
 * In Part c of Exercise 8.22, we developed a solution to the Knight’s Tour problem. The approach used, called the 
 * “accessibility heuristic,” generates many solutions and executes efficiently. As computers continue to increase in power, 
 * we’ll be able to solve more problems with sheer computer power and relatively unsophisticated algorithms. Let’s call this 
 * approach “brute-force” problem solving.

 * 7.29 (Coin Tossing) 
 * Write an app that simulates coin tossing. Let the app toss a coin each time the user chooses the “Toss Coin” menu 
 * option. Count the number of times each side of the coin appears. Display the results. The app should call a separate 
 * method Flip that takes no arguments and returns false for tails and true for heads. [Note: If the app realistically 
 * simulates coin tossing, each side of the coin should appear approximately half the time.]

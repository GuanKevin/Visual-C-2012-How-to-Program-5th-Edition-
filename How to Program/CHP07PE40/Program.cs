 * 7.40 (Computer-Assisted Instruction: Reducing Student Fatigue) 
 * One problem in CAI environments is student fatigue. This can be reduced by varying the computer’s responses to hold 
 * the student’s attention. Modify the program of Exercise 7.39 so that various comments are displayed for each answer. 
 * Possible responses to a correct answer: 
 * Very good! 
 * Excellent! 
 * Nice work! 
 * Keep up the good work! 
 * Possible responses to an incorrect answer: 
 * No. 
 * Please try again. 
 * Wrong. 
 * Try once more. 
 * Don't give up! 
 * No. Keep trying.
 * Use random-number generation to choose a number from 1 to 4 that will be used to select one of the four appropriate 
 * responses to each correct or incorrect answer. Use a switch statement to issue the responses.

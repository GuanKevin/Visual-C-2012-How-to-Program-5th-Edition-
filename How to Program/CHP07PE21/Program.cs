 * 7.21 (Separating Digits) 
 * Write code segments that accomplish each of the following tasks:
 * a) Calculate the integer part of the quotient when integer a is divided by integer b.
 * b) Calculate the integer remainder when integer a is divided by integer b.
 * c) Use the app pieces developed in parts (a) and (b) to write a method DisplayDigits that
 * receives an integer between 1 and 99999 and displays it as a sequence of digits, separating each pair of digits by 
 * two spaces. For example, the integer 4562 should appear as: 4 5 6 2.
 * d) Incorporate the method developed in part (c) into an app that inputs an integer and calls DisplayDigits by passing 
 * the method the integer entered. Display the results.

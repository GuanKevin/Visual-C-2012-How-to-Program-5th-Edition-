/**
 * 4.13 (Employee Class) 
 * Create a class called Employee that includes three pieces of information as either instance variables or 
 * automatic properties—a first name (type string), a last name (type string) and a monthly salary (decimal). 
 * Your class should have a constructor that initializes the three values. Provide a property with a get 
 * and set accessor for any instance variables. If the monthly salary is negative, the set accessor should 
 * leave the instance variable unchanged. Write a test app named EmployeeTest that demonstrates class Employee’s 
 * capabilities. Create two Employee objects and display each object’s yearly salary. Then give each Employee a 
 * 10% raise and display each Employee’s yearly salary again.

 * 8.25 (Eight Queens: Brute-Force Approaches) In this exercise, you’ll develop several brute-force approaches to solving the 
 * Eight Queens problem introduced in Exercise 8.24. 
 * a) Use the random brute-force technique developed in Exercise 8.23 to solve the Eight Queens problem. 
 * b) Use an exhaustive technique (i.e., try all possible combinations of eight queens on the chessboard) 
 * to solve the Eight Queens problem.
